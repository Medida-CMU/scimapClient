Description: Calling scimapRegister() sends a packet to sci-net-map.isri.cmu.edu
	stating an anonymous ID uniquely identifying your installation, and listing
	which R packages you currently have loaded.
	By habitually running it at the end of all your scripts, you can help the 
	creators/maintainers of scientific software packages show
	the breadth of use and impact of their software to funding agencies, tenure committees, etc.
