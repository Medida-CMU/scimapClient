\description{
Enable or revoke permission for usage tracking
}
\details{
Enable or revoke permission for the package to
 send usage statistics to \code{scisoft-net-map.isri.cmu.edu}.

 This is run by hand in interactive mode; there is no
 need to put in a script.  Once you have revoked permission with \code{disableScimap},
 the scimapClient package will not track your usage again
 until you run \code{enableScimap()}

 You can temporarily revoke permission (just until R is stopped and restarted)
 with \code{disableScimapThisSession}.
